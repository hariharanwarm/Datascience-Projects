--*****************************Basic Quality checks***********************************************
--1.How many records has each TPEP provider provided? Write a query that summarises the number of records of each provider.
select vendorid,count(vendorid) from taxi_data group by vendorid;
--vendorid 1 has provided 8447149 records
--vendorid 2 has provided 10345930 records
--there are a couple of null records

--2.conclusion on data quality issue 
--VendorID -- has a couple of null values
--tpep_pickup_datetime and tpep_dropoff_datetime- has the following NULL,2001,2003,2008,2009,2041,2017,2018 which seems to be erroneous
--passenger_count - there are values such as 0 and 192 that is erroneous and need tobe removed
--trip_distance - the min is 0 and max is 708 which is erroneous,hence a suitable range to be chosen
--RatecodeID - an invalid value i.e 99 seen
--store_and_fwd_flag - a couple of null values
--PULocationID  - a couple of null values
--DOLocationID  - a couple of null values
--payment_type  - a couple of null values,values present are 1,2,3,4
--fare_amount-there are outliers such as in negative values and there is a max value ie 393221.5 which is erroneous
--extra - there are values other than 0,0.5 and 1 ,
--mta_tax - there are values other than 0.5 and 0 which is erroneous,
--tip_amount- there are outliers such as negative and tip amount greater than fare amount ,
--tolls_amount - outliers seen such as negative values,
--improvement_surcharge - values other than 0.3 seen
--for further analyses the data will be cleaned based on above analysis

--worst vendor based on fare_amount
select vendorid,count(*) from taxi_data where fare_amount not between 0 and 1000 group by vendorid;
